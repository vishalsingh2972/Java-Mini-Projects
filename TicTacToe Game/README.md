# Tic Tac Toe game

In this project, I have built a simple multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game using Java

## Game rules

- In this game Player 1 is using 'X' and Player 2 is using 'O'
- The game starts with player 1 choosing an available cell and marking it as 'X' in the board and then player 2 choosing an available cell and marking it as 'O' in the board
- A player wins by getting 3 cells marked with their letter, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally
- If none of the players is able to win before the board runs out of available cells it's declared a draw
- Enjoy
