# Tic Tac Toe Game

In this project, I have built a multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game using Java

## Game rules
This is a very simple Tic Tac Toe Game and it's played as follows:

- This game is a 1 vs 1 table game
- You will see a 3 by 3 board with 9 spaces in total
- In this game Player 1 is using 'X' and Player 2 is using 'O'
- The game starts with Player 1 choosing an available cell and marking it as 'X' in the board and then player 2 choosing an available cell and marking it as 'O' in the board
- A player wins by getting 3 cells marked with their letter, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally
- If none of the players is able to win before the board runs out of available cells it's declared a draw
- Enjoy
